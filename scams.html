            <h2>Common Scams</h2>
            <p>Fraudsters are constantly coming up with new ways to trick people. Here are some of the most common scams to watch out for.</p>

            <h3>Phishing Scams</h3>
            <p>As mentioned in the Digital Safety section, phishing scams involve emails, text messages, or websites that are designed to look like they're from a legitimate company. They aim to trick you into providing sensitive information like your password or credit card number.</p>
            <p><strong>How to avoid them:</strong> Never click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders. Always verify the sender's email address and look for spelling and grammar errors.</p>

            <h3>Tech Support Scams</h3>
            <p>In a tech support scam, a fraudster will contact you pretending to be from a well-known tech company like Microsoft or Apple. They'll claim that your computer has a virus and that you need to pay them to fix it. They may ask for remote access to your computer, which can allow them to install malware.</p>
            <p><strong>How to avoid them:</strong> Legitimate tech companies will not contact you unsolicited. If you get a call or a pop-up message about a computer problem, it's likely a scam. Don't give anyone remote access to your computer unless you have initiated the contact with a trusted company.</p>

            <h3>Fake E-commerce Sites</h3>
            <p>These are fraudulent websites that are set up to look like real online stores. They may offer products at very low prices to lure you in. If you make a purchase, you'll either receive a counterfeit item or nothing at all.</p>
            <p><strong>How to avoid them:</strong> Stick to well-known, reputable websites. Look for reviews of the seller before making a purchase. Be wary of deals that seem too good to be true.</p>
