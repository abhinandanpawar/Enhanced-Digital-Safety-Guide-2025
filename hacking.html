            <h2>How to Know If You've Been Hacked (And What to Do)</h2>
            <p>A computer hack is rarely as obvious as a big warning message on your screen. Most of the time, cyberattacks are subtle and can go undetected for a long time. Here are some common signs that your computer or accounts may have been compromised.</p>

            <h3>7 Signs Your Computer Has Been Hacked</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Applications Appear That You Didn’t Install:</strong> If you see new programs or apps on your device that you don't remember installing, it could be a sign of a breach.</li>
                <li><strong>Unusual Disk Activity:</strong> If you see your mouse moving on its own, or your hard drive is constantly working even when you're not doing anything, it could be a sign that a hacker is controlling your device remotely.</li>
                <li><strong>Strange Messages Sent From Your Accounts:</strong> If your friends or contacts tell you they've received strange emails or social media messages from you that you didn't send, your accounts may be compromised.</li>
                <li><strong>Passwords Suddenly Don’t Work:</strong> If your login credentials for a website or service suddenly stop working, a hacker may have gained access and changed them.</li>
                <li><strong>Unwanted Browser Toolbars and Pop-ups:</strong> If your browser has new toolbars you didn't install, or you're seeing a lot of pop-up ads, your browser may have been hijacked.</li>
                <li><strong>Unwanted Software Installations:</strong> Many malicious programs bundle themselves with legitimate software. Always be careful what you agree to install.</li>
                <li><strong>Strange Network Traffic Patterns:</strong> If you notice a lot of unexpected network activity, especially to or from countries you don't do business with, it could be a sign that your data is being stolen.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>What to Do Immediately (Disaster Management)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Disconnect from the Internet:</strong> If you suspect a hack, immediately disconnect your computer from the internet to prevent the hacker from causing more damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Change Your Passwords:</strong> Change the passwords for all your important accounts, especially email, banking, and social media. Use a different, secure computer to do this if possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Run Antivirus and Anti-Malware Scans:</strong> Use a reputable security program to scan your computer for viruses and malware and remove any threats it finds.</li>
                <li><strong>Notify Your Contacts:</strong> Let your friends, family, and colleagues know that your accounts may have been compromised, so they can be wary of any strange messages from you.</li>
                <li><strong>Report the Incident:</strong> Report the hack to the relevant authorities, such as the FTC or the FBI's IC3.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Prevent Hacking</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> This is your first line of defense.</li>
                <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> This adds a crucial layer of security to your accounts.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep Your Software Updated:</strong> Software updates often contain important security patches.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Wary of Phishing:</strong> Don't click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders.</li>
                <li><strong>Use a Firewall:</strong> A firewall can help block unauthorized access to your computer.</li>
