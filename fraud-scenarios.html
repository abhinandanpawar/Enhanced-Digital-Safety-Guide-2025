            <h3>Phishing Email Example: The Netflix Scam</h3>
            <p>Phishing emails are a common way for scammers to steal your personal information. They send you an email that looks like it's from a company you trust, like Netflix, and ask you to update your account details.</p>
            <p>Here is a description of a real phishing email that was sent to Netflix users. Imagine receiving an email with the Netflix logo at the top and a subject line like "Your account is on hold."</p>
            <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
                <p><strong>From:</strong> Netflix Support &lt;support@netflix-billing.com&gt;</p>
                <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Your account is on hold</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Hi Dear,</p>
                <p>We're having some trouble with your current billing information. We'll try again, but in the meantime you may want to update your payment details.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                    <a href="#" style="background-color: #e50914; color: white; padding: 10px 20px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px;">UPDATE ACCOUNT NOW</a>
                </p>
                <p>Need help? We're here if you need it. Visit the Help Centre or contact us now.</p>
                <p>- Your friends at Netflix</p>
            </div>

            <h4>How to Spot This Scam</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Generic Greeting:</strong> The email starts with "Hi Dear," which is a common sign of a phishing email. Legitimate companies will usually address you by your name.</li>
                <li><strong>Sense of Urgency:</strong> The email claims your account is "on hold" and urges you to "UPDATE ACCOUNT NOW." Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into acting without thinking.</li>
                <li><strong>Suspicious Link:</strong> While you can't see the link in the image, if you were to hover over the "UPDATE ACCOUNT NOW" button, the link would likely go to a fake website that looks like Netflix, but is designed to steal your login and payment information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What to Do</h4>
            <p>If you receive an email like this, do not click on any links. Instead, go directly to the Netflix website in your browser and log in to your account to check for any issues. You can also report the phishing email to the company and to the Anti-Phishing Working Group.</p>
