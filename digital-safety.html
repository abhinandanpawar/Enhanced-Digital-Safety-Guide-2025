            <h2>Digital Safety Basics</h2>
            <p>Staying safe online involves a few key practices that can significantly reduce your risk of becoming a victim of digital fraud.</p>

            <h3>Create Strong, Unique Passwords</h3>
            <p>A strong password is your first line of defense. Here are some tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
                <li>Make it long, at least 12 characters.</li>
                <li>Avoid using personal information like your name or birthday.</li>
                <li>Use a different password for each of your accounts. A password manager can help you keep track of them.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>
            <p>Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts. Even if someone steals your password, they won't be able to log in without the second factor, which is usually a code sent to your phone.</p>

            <h3>Be Cautious of Phishing Emails</h3>
            <p>Phishing emails are designed to trick you into giving up your personal information. Be wary of emails that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a sense of urgency, pressuring you to act quickly.</li>
                <li>Contain spelling and grammar errors.</li>
                <li>Ask you to click on a suspicious link or download an attachment.</li>
                <li>Come from an email address that doesn't match the sender's organization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you're unsure about an email, don't click on any links. Instead, go directly to the organization's website by typing the address in your browser.</p>

            <h3>Keep Your Software Updated</h3>
            <p>Software updates often contain important security patches. Make sure your operating system, browser, and other applications are set to update automatically.</p>
