            <h2>Traffic Rules in India: A Guide to the Motor Vehicles Act</h2>
            <p>Understanding and following traffic rules is crucial for the safety of everyone on the road. In India, the main law that governs road transport is the Motor Vehicles Act. This guide provides an overview of the act and some of its key provisions.</p>

            <h3>The Motor Vehicles Act: An Overview</h3>
            <p>The Indian Parliament passed the Motor Vehicles Act to regulate all aspects of road transport in the country. The act has evolved over the years, with major versions in 1914, 1988, and a significant amendment in 2019 to make the rules stricter and improve road safety.</p>

            <h3>Key Provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act</h3>
            <p>Here are some of the most important rules and regulations that every driver in India should be aware of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compulsory Licensing and Registration:</strong> It is mandatory for all drivers to have a valid driving license and for all vehicles to be registered with the authorities.</li>
                <li><strong>Carry Your Documents:</strong> You must always carry your driving license, vehicle registration certificate, and insurance documents with you and be ready to produce them when requested by a police officer.</li>
                <li><strong>Age Restrictions:</strong> Only individuals above the age of 20 are permitted to drive a transport vehicle in a public place. There are also specific age criteria for obtaining a learner's license and a permanent driving license.</li>
                <li><strong>Aadhaar Card Mandatory:</strong> The 2019 amendment made it mandatory to link your Aadhaar card when applying for a driving license or vehicle registration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Penalties for Common Offences (as per the 2019 Amendment)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Drunk Driving:</strong> The penalty for driving under the influence of alcohol has been increased to ₹10,000.</li>
                <li><strong>Juvenile Driving:</strong> If a minor is caught violating traffic rules, their guardian or the owner of the vehicle will be held responsible.</li>
                <li><strong>Hit-and-Run Cases:</strong> In the tragic event of a hit-and-run that results in a death, the government provides a compensation of ₹2 lakhs or more to the victim's family.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Importance of Vehicle Insurance</h3>
            <p>The Motor Vehicles Act also makes it mandatory for all vehicles to have at least a third-party insurance policy. This ensures that if you are involved in an accident, the damages to the other person or their vehicle are covered.</p>

            <p>By following these rules, we can all contribute to making our roads safer for everyone.</p>
